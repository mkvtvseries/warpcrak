WarpWallet Cracker
==================

A very, very basic WarpWallet cracker that can optionally use an
insight-api server to check the wallets of each address it loops over.
Does *not* test that it has already checked an address before. It is
extremely unlikely you will actually manage to crack an address using
this (or even find a wallet with money in)

FWIW: You should not steal money from wallets you find. Do NOT use this
tool for malicious reasons. Solely made for education.

Keybase have some nice little challenges for WarpWallet cracking. You
can see some of the active challenges here: https://keybase.io/warp - as
of 2nd May 2016 there is currently a challenge for 20 BTC (worth
$8927.80 at the time of writing)

This is by no means optimised and just serves as a proof of concept for
some ideas I have for the future. I currently have this sitting on an
idle server I had, it's not costing me any more money and who knows -
one of us might actually brute force it one day.

If you wanted to optimise this, I'd recommend writing it in something
more low level (obviously not something that runs in a VM) and take
advantage NVIDIA's CUDA cores.

Syntax:
    mvn install

    # [address to crack] [salt] [passphrase length]
    java -jar target/WarpWallet-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar 1AdU3EcimMFN7JLJtceSyrmFYE3gF5ZnGj a@b.c 8
